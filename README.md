## ðŸ“œ Overview
This repository contains the **design and implementation of an Asynchronous FIFO** in Verilog HDL, based on proven methodologies for reliable **Clock Domain Crossing (CDC)**.

The design uses **Gray code pointers** to ensure safe synchronization between asynchronous write and read clock domains, along with robust `full` and `empty` detection logic.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Dual-clock asynchronous FIFO**
- **Gray code pointer synchronization**
- **Full and Empty flag logic**
- Modular, synthesis-friendly architecture
