# Asynchrous-FIFO
An asynchronous First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memory buffer designed to safely transfer data between two clock domains operating at different frequencies. Implements dual-clock design using Gray code pointers for reliable read/write synchronization, with parameterizable data width and depth. Includes simulation testbenches for functional verification.
